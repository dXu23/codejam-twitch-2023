# 2023 Codejam

## Project Description

At the moment, I'm not too sure what this project is going to be. I have an idea for a
Twitch feature redeem that allows a viewer to redeem points to play back a random clip
from a previous stream; however, it seems only marginally related to the theme of time,
in that it plays something from the past and is meant to invoke a feeling of nostalgia.
If anyone on the team has a better idea, I would be more than willing to replace the
current idea for the project with a new one.

I figured that a C++ project involving OBS would be a good fit since C++ isn't geared
towards interacting with web APIs. However, pretty sure that for the current idea
to work, the Twitch API will be required in order to play back a Twitch streamer clip
using an embed link.
